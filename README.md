# MTA_Analysis

## Primary Goals / Methodology:

Our primary goal in this presentation is to maximize the number of signatures obtained at subway station entrances/exits via street marketing teams, focusing on those individuals who will attend the gala and contribute to WTWYâ€™s cause.

To do so, we will look at MTA subway data as well as US Census data such as median household income to determine, not just the busiest stations, but the stations with the most value-added individuals considering our prompt above. Furthermore, we will look at the number of tech companies near stations to determine best allotment of street marketing team placement to properly capture our target group

## Data URLS:

1. Here is link to MTA Website [MTA TURNSTILE DATA](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)
2. Here is link to Kaggle US Census Data [US CENSUS DATA](https://www.kaggle.com/census/us-population-by-zip-code)

## Our Approach

1. Find zipcodes of NYC stations and census data such as median household income
2. Find the latitude and longitude of NYC top tech companies and map it on a map
3. Determine the busiest stations for the month of September
4. Look at housing value according to zip codes to determine stations with high traffic as well as high income earners
5. Look at the map to see which of these stations are nearby top tech companies
6. Come up with a list of recommended stations to focus volunteer teams on
7. Determine day of week and specific time for each recommended station

## Recommendations:

Based on high traffic, median income and women population, we recommend WTWY streat teams in the following stations: W 4TH ST-Washington SQ, 14 ST, 23 ST, 28 ST, CHAMBERS ST, 34 ST-HERALD SQ.  To be more specific, we recommend between Tuseday and Friday as traffic flow drastically decreased from Saturday to Monday. In terms of specific time of the day, we recommend between 12pm and 4pm at 14 ST, 23 ST, 28 ST and W 4TH ST-Washington SQ. We recommend between 4pm and 8pm at 34 ST-HEARLD SQ, CHAMBERS ST. Keeping in mind the willingness window where people are more ameable and charitable at specfic times of the day - after meal / happy hour, a further exploration of each station to see hour to hour change in traffic would be important. It is also important to realize the fact that there will be diminishing returns as traffic flow increases - streat teams can only engage with so many people at once. In that sense finding the sweet spot where streat teams can maximize engagement with the traffic flow would be important
