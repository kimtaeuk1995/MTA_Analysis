# MTA_Analysis

## Primary Goals / Methodology:

Our primary goal in this presentation is to maximize the number of signatures obtained at subway station entrances/exits via street marketing teams, focusing on those individuals who will attend the gala and contribute to WTWYâ€™s cause.

To do so, we will look at MTA subway data as well as NYC Census data such as median household income to determine, not just the busiest stations, but the stations with the most value-added individuals considering our prompt above. Furthermore, we will look at the number of tech companies near stations to determine best allotment of street marketing team placement to properly capture our target group

## Our Approach

1. Find zipcodes of NYC stations and census data such as median household income
2. Find the latitude and longitude of NYC top tech companies and map it on a map
3. Determine the busiest stations for the month of september
4. Look at housing value according to zip codes to determine stations with high traffic as well as high income earners
5. Look at the map to see which of these stations are nearby top tech companies
6. Determine day of week and specific time for each recommended station
